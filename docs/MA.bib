  abstract = {Primarily from a measurement standpoint, we question some basic beliefs and procedures characterizing the scientific study of human behavior. The relations between observed and unobserved variables are key to an empirical approach to building explanatory theories and we are especially concerned about how the former are used as proxies for the latter. We believe that behavioral science can profitably reconsider the prevailing version of this arrangement because of its vulnerability to limiting idiosyncratic aspects of observed/unobserved variable relations. We describe a general measurement approach that takes into account idiosyncrasies that should be irrelevant to the measurement process but can intrude and may invalidate it in ways that distort and weaken relations among theoretically important variables. To clarify further our major concerns, we briefly describe one version of the measurement approach that fundamentally supports the individual as the primary unit of analysis orientation that we believe should be preeminent in the scientific study of human behavior.},

invariant across subjects and thus the appropriate unit of analysis. We disagree and take
the view that between factor correlations may differ systematically across subjects. And
further, individual differences in these correlations may be an important source of
information about each unique individual. Following from this premise, analyses of
consistencies and differences between subjects of the within subject pattern of
inter-factor correlations is a step towards an integrative science of behavior. We give
several examples demonstrating how this approach has the potential to yield novel insights
into personality functioning.},

In this article we address three levels at which people differ: within individuals, between individuals, and between groups of individuals. A dynamic model of personality is considered where traits are seen as rates of change in states in response to environmental cues. Within individuals, motivational and behavioral states show inertial properties and lead to an analysis of rates of change and latencies of behavior. Between individuals, the analysis is one of frequency and duration of choices. When individuals self select into groups reflecting shared interests and abilities, the structure of these group differences reflects the consequences of the self selection. Examples of the dynamic model are given for each level of analysis.},

Current practice in cognitive psychology is to accept a single model on the basis of only the “raw” AIC values, making it difficult to unambiguously interpret the observed AIC differences in terms of a continuous measure such as probability. Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model. We show by example how these Akaike weights can greatly facilitate the interpretation of the results of AIC model comparison procedures.},

This paper studies the general theory of the AIC procedure and provides its analytical extensions in two ways without violating Akaike's main principles. These extensions make AIC asymptotically consistent and penalize overparameterization more stringently to pick only the simplest of the “true” models. These selection criteria are called CAIC and CAICF. Asymptotic properties of AIC and its extensions are investigated, and empirical performances of these criteria are studied in choosing the correct degree of a polynomial model in two different Monte Carlo experiments under different conditions.},

Since assumptions imply some kind of scientific model, I believe that it is necessary to look at the process of scientific modelling itself to understand the nature of and the need for robust procedures. Against such a view it might be urged that some useful robust procedures have been derived empirically without an explicitly stated model. However, an empirical procedure implies some unstated model and there is often great virtue in bringing into the open the kind of assumptions that lead to useful methods. The need for robust methods seems to be intimately mixed up with the need for simple models. This we now discuss.},
