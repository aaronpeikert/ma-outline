  abstract = {After a glance at the relatively accidental, historical grouping of features in the Wundt-Pavlov and Galton-Spearman research traditions, we have embraced in the last chapter a new and more comprehensive view of the taxonomy of possible research designs. Therein we have recognized three “panels”—or separate areas of decision that contribute to the total planning of an investigation—namely, hypothesis theme (theory), experimental design, and analysis method, each with a set of four or more definable parameters.},

  abstract = {Primarily from a measurement standpoint, we question some basic beliefs and procedures characterizing the scientific study of human behavior. The relations between observed and unobserved variables are key to an empirical approach to building explanatory theories and we are especially concerned about how the former are used as proxies for the latter. We believe that behavioral science can profitably reconsider the prevailing version of this arrangement because of its vulnerability to limiting idiosyncratic aspects of observed/unobserved variable relations. We describe a general measurement approach that takes into account idiosyncrasies that should be irrelevant to the measurement process but can intrude and may invalidate it in ways that distort and weaken relations among theoretically important variables. To clarify further our major concerns, we briefly describe one version of the measurement approach that fundamentally supports the individual as the primary unit of analysis orientation that we believe should be preeminent in the scientific study of human behavior.},

invariant across subjects and thus the appropriate unit of analysis. We disagree and take
the view that between factor correlations may differ systematically across subjects. And
further, individual differences in these correlations may be an important source of
information about each unique individual. Following from this premise, analyses of
consistencies and differences between subjects of the within subject pattern of
inter-factor correlations is a step towards an integrative science of behavior. We give
several examples demonstrating how this approach has the potential to yield novel insights
into personality functioning.},

  abstract = {People differ. How and why they differ are the fundamental questions for personality psychologists. In this article we address three levels at which people differ: within individuals, between individuals, and between groups of individuals. A dynamic model of personality is considered where traits are seen as rates of change in states in response to environmental cues. Within individuals, motivational and behavioral states show inertial properties and lead to an analysis of rates of change and latencies of behavior. Between individuals, the analysis is one of frequency and duration of choices. When individuals self select into groups reflecting shared interests and abilities, the structure of these group differences reflects the consequences of the self selection. Examples of the dynamic model are given for each level of analysis.},
